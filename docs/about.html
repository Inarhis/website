       Hello, I’m Jianne Soto, a recent UC Santa Cruz graduate with a BA in Art and Design: Games and Playable Media and a minor in Technology and Information Management. I’m passionate about stepping into the world of UI and UX design, where I can combine my love for visual storytelling and data driven insights to create user friendly digital experiences. During my studies, I created interactive prototypes and wireframes in Photoshop, crafted motion design projects in After Effects, and polished illustrations in Illustrator. I also conducted usability tests with classmates and refined my work based on their feedback. In roles at Learning Support Services and the Disability Resource Center, I collaborated with students and faculty to streamline workflows and improve accessibility. I thrive on empathy led design and iterative problem solving, and I’m eager to launch my career crafting interfaces that delight and empower users.
